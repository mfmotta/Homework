# Homework


Here are the homework assignments from the course I attended at EPFL with Michele Catasta: 
[Applied Data Analysis](http://ada.epfl.ch/). This course is part of the Master's degree program in Computer Science.

I have worked on these assignments within a team and [this](https://github.com/ggrrll/tatoule) is our public repo. Here, however, you can find more details on how I thought things through.

The Github repo of the course can be found [here](https://github.com/ADAEPFL/Homework).
