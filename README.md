# Homework


Here are the homework assignments from the course I attended at EPFL with Michele Catasta: 
[Applied Data Analysis](http://ada.epfl.ch/). This course is part of the Master's degree program in Computer Science.

I have worked on these assignments within a team and [this](https://github.com/mfmotta/tatoule) is our public repo. Here, however, you can find more details on how I thought things through. I often come back for completing and improving this repo, it has a valuable content and is certainly helpful to people which started diving into the world of Data Science. Any feedback or questions is more than welcome!

The Github repo of the course can be found [here](https://github.com/ADAEPFL/Homework).
